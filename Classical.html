			<h3 class="step16">Considered to be the oldest dance form in India, Bharatnatyam has essentially originated from Tamil Nadu and is a delightful combination of traditional sadir punched up with expression, music, beat and dance. This form of dance is slow and moving, but at times fast and fluid and hence is also called Fire Dance.The performance repertoire of Bharatanatyam, like other classical dances, includes nrita (pure dance), nritya (solo expressive dance) and natya (group dramatic dance). Bharatanatyam remained exclusive to Hindu temples through the 19th century. A form of illustrative anecdote of Hindu religious themes and spiritual ideas emoted by dancer with excellent footwork and impressive gestures its performance repertoire includes nrita, nritya and natya. Accompanists include a singer, music and particularly the guru who directs and conducts the performance. <a href="https://www.culturalindia.net/indian-dance/classical/bharatnatyam.html">To get more Information click here</a></h3>

			<h1>Kathakali:</h1><o class="step15"></o>

			<h3 class="step16">Kathakali’, an important genre in the Indian classical dance form, is associated with storytelling form of this art. It is the dance drama from the south Indian state of Kerala. Similar to other Indian classical dance arts, the story in ‘Kathakali’ is also communicated to audience through excellent footwork and impressive gestures of face and hands complimented with music and vocal performance. However it can be distinguished from the others through the intricate and vivid make-up, unique face masks and costumes worn by dancers as also from their style and movements that reflect the age-old martial arts and athletic conventions prevalent in Kerala and surrounding regions. Traditionally performed by male dancers, it developed in courts and theatres of Hindu regions contrary to other Indian classical dances which predominantly developed in Hindu temples and monastic schools. Although not clearly traceable, this classical dance form is considered to have originated from temple and folk arts that trace back to 1st millennium CE or before.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathakali">To get more Information click here</a></h3>

			<h1>Kuchipudi:</h1><o class="step15"></o>

			<o class="step15"></o><a name="Kuchipudi">
			<h3 class="step16">Kuchipudi is a dance-drama performance, with its roots in the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text of Natya Shastra. It developed as a religious art linked to traveling bards, temples and spiritual beliefs, like all major classical dances of India.Evidence of Kuchipudi's existence in an older version are found in copper inscriptions of the 10th century, and by the 15th century in texts such as the Machupalli Kaifat.[8][9] Kuchipudi tradition holds that Tirtha Narayana Yati – a sanyassin of Advaita Vedanta persuasion,and his disciple, an orphan named Siddhendra Yogi, founded and systematized the modern version of Kuchipudi in the 17th century.Kuchipudi largely developed as a Hindu god Krishna-oriented Vaishnavism tradition,and it is most closely related to Bhagavata Mela.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuchipudi">To get more Information click here</a></h3>
